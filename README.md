# AlphaFold-Wrapper for small HPC systems

⚠️⚠️⚠️ WORK IN PROGRESS ⚠️⚠️⚠️

This repository contains a set of instructions on how-to-install alphafold on a HPC cluster. It is based on the [alphafold repository](https://github.com/google-deepmind/alphafold).

There they go over the instructions to install alphafold on a single machine with Docker - however you might want to install it in your local cluster. This repository contains a step-by-step installation procedure as well as a custom-built wrapper CLI to facilitate the execution of alphafold in a _small_ HPC environment.

Note that this is **not** an in-depth guide and **not** affiliated with alphafold - please check their documentation for an updated and official instructions. This repo is rather a set of instructions of a case that worked for me. I hope it can be useful for others as well.
